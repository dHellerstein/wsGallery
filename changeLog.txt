
 ---- Ver 1_45 changes (16 July 2025)

See below for propr changes.

Ver 1_45 does not add much funcdtionality. It did introduce a number of "decluttering" changes to the user interface , fixed some small bugs,
and added to the documentation.

Noticeable changes include:

  * The top bar has a "chose gallery/tree/dir" button, and a choose viewing mode button. Both of these will display larger menus.
  * The top bar also has a "change wsGallery version" button (standard, simple, compact). 
  * There are 4 viewing modes:  singleImage (the "standard"), dual image, rotating image, and tableau.
    These can be chosen from the top bar, and (selectively) from within each viewing mode. 
    There are fewer "switch viewing mode" buttons within each viewing mode (part of the decluttering).
  * The "single image" viewer (which is considered to be the standard) has fewer choices (decluttering!)    
    You can switch to singleImage viewer for any image being displayed in the dual image, rotating, or tableau  viewers -- using
    image specific buttons displayed near the image. 
  * The dual image viewer also has fewer choices. 
    Switching the dual image variant (3 different pre set sizes) is with just one button (at the top of the file-list pane).
  * However, for both dual and single a new option is added: create and display links to individual images (suitable inclusion in emails, other
    web pages, etc)
  * Small bugs adding image specific notes, and keywords, have been fixed.
  * For administators: a "check for changes" button added for each tree. When checked, all directories in a tree are searched. If
    there are differences between files (files removed, files added, files changes) highlighting is done to indicate that changes occured.
    You can also view a list of changes.
    This allows the admin to find just what directories have changed, and update their "cached information". Rather that the possibly slow
    process of updating every directory in a tree.

Note: "single image" uses 2 "panes": the "file list", and "viewer".
      "dual image" uses 3 "panes": the "file list", "preview", and "full view". larger pane). The relative sizes of these panes can be quickly
      changed usinfg the "switch dual image variant" button (at the top of the file view pane)

June 25 2022  20220627.v1_3.
  * Add a "small viewer" -- suitable for pads and smart phones. wsGallery_small.php (and wsGallery_small.js) 

  * Small changes to wsGallery_get.js (to retrive just an array or object  -- without trying to write to html)

  * Add a "would you like to use compact viewer" if small screen size detected.

June 25 2022  20220625.v1_3.
   * Modified wsgallery_simple and wsGallery_get.js.  Add a "redisplay image maintaining aspect ratio" button.
     Clicking it will redisplay the image with width and height attributes that maintain the image's original aspect ratio
     (ratio of width to height)

June 21 2022  20220620.v1_3.

   * Added a "view compressed list of directories" -- a list of buttons (of dir names), click one to scroll to that
     directory in the list of directories

   * If installing v1_3 over an older version, you will probably have to delete the treeList.json, and dirList.json files.
     It is fairly quick to recreate these (you do NOT have to recreate the thumbnails, etc).

   * Create _keywords.json whenever admin adds a keyword. This complements _keywords.json create when admin
     views keywords (that may have been added to by a user in the recent past)

   * Added a "please wait" message when user views keywords (for all files in a directory)
   
   * Added a check window and screen width and height -- alert a warning if too small (the minSizeViewing parameter
     in wsGallery.php). By default, 400 is used (pixels).

   * Fixed small bugs in singleImage viewer (was not shrinking image).

   * Fixed small tree switch bugs 

June 20 2022  20220620.v1_3.

  * Augmented keyword support. Admin can view and  keywords for all files in a directory (on one screen).

  * User can view keywords for all files in a directory (using the "list" fileList display mode)
  
  * "listDisplay" is used in the button to switch between button, list, and table display (of files in a directory)
  
  * Users can set a few default parameters (gallery, tree, dir, screenLayout, thumbnails, listDisplay" -- using cookies.
    This is done using the 'gear' settings button (upper right corner)

  * Admin logon button now requires clickin the 'gear' button first
  
  * "large single image viewer" is no longer one of the screen layouts.  
     However: you can switch to it under the singleViewer  screen layout. 
     That is: the 2/3 image, 1/3 file list is now the sole single image viewer, but a resize to "large
     single image viewer" button is available under single image viewer

   * Tableau mode by default starts with file listin upper 1/4 of screen.
     You can use 2 buttons (on top line) to switch between the default (file list in upper 1/4), and a
     most of screen used for tableau (file list is hidden behind the tableau viewer)

   * pgUp and pgDn can be use to  view prior and next images.
   
   * useThumbnails parameter now in wsGallery_params.php

June 11 2022  20220612.v1_3.

  * Added maxNoteSize parameter -- limits total size of a notes file (to prevent hackers for filling up hard drive)
  
  * _flag.txt updated in galleries/gallery/tree/dir whenever a note/keyword is added (to a file in this cache dir)
  
  * Save _keywords.json whenever keywords-for-all-files-in-a-dir are looked up. 
    If this file is newer than _flag.txt -- use it when displaying all keyword for all files in a directory (hence,
    do not re-create each time).

  * Create _keywords.json whenever admin requests "view all keywords for all files" (in the change descriptions for files menu)
 
  *  User can display a table of all keywords in all files (in a directory) -- IF _keywords.json was created by admin.
     Note that _keywords.json may be out of data (if keywords were recently added).
     A button to display the file is the first column of the table.
     This uses the  "singleImage" viewer.
     
  * In the "display a list of all keywords in all files ..." -- user can specify one (or several) keywords so search for.
    Matches will have their "button to display ..." highlighted.
    

June 11 2022  20220611.v1_3.

  * File keywords can be be displayed for each file in a directory (in an admin mode)

  * The icon for "view files in a directory" (admin mode) was changed (as was the title)

  * Added a "view in tableau mode" icon to singleImage viewer. A bit buggy -- will add current image to tableau

  * Favorites now include a "created by" field. Public favorites-list can be displayed in a table, each row containing the
    favorite-lists created by the same person (by the same value of the "created by" field).

  * Minor changes to favorites view and specification (a few more quick jump buttons).

June 8 2022 20220608.v1_3.

 * Support for "alternative tree names. An `altname` can be displayed in the "select a tree" buttons --
   it can be several words long.  Specified in wsGallery_treeList.php

 * Support for customized size and location for the dual-viewer, preset 3, screen layout.
   By default, this layout has large viewer (viewer 2) in the lower 3/4 of the screen, and
   the small (preview viewer, viewer 1), and file list, in the upper 1/4.
   The locations & size of all 3 of these can be set in wsGallery_params.php
   
 * toggleViewInfo bug (not showing information in viewers when switching to dual viewer) -- needs to be resolved.
 
Changes before v1_3 

 * Support for "collections" -- a selectable set of directories that are treated like a tree.
   Each of thes directories can come from any gallery or tree.
   The original directories are not touched -- a collection is an alternative way of allowing the
   user to select from a "collection" of directories. 
   For example, all directories from the same month, but from "trees" specific to different individuals.
   The administrator can create as many collections as desired.

 * Support for favorites -- a selectable list of files that are treated like a directory.
   Each of these files can come from any gallery / tree / directory.
   As with collections, the original files are not touched.
   For example: all photos of your grandmother (that may be located in a number of different trees).
   Users can create and save as many favorite-list as they want -- storage can be on their own computer,
   or (if the administrator sets a parameter in wsGallery_params.php), on the server.

 * Support for file-notes. Users can add notes (and keyword) to individual files. These notes can be viewed
   at a later date by any visitor to the site (not only the person who created a note). Notes are cumulative --
   additional notes are added without overwriting prior notes.
   
  * Reorganized the "dual viewer" presets -- their location and size better complement screen layouts such as singleImage.
